As a matter of fact, a significant proportion of Indian students, are stressed out due to employment
issues ,they are either unemployed or arenâ€™t satisfied with their current job. So we have come up
with an artificially intelligent system which aims at providing one stop solution to all the graduates
for checking their industrial readiness. Through our unique gamified assessment , our system will
assess the user on wide array of parameters divided into three categories namely .Soft skills - Soft
skills are character traits and interpersonal skills that characterize a person's relationships with
other people .Problem solving aptitude - Problem-solving ability is a multi-faceted competency
that uses other skills discussed throughout the Leaders Are Clear Thinkers section, including
conceptual thinking, planning and organization, and creativity. 3)Domain specific knowledge - An
expert is a person with extensive knowledge about a particular subject matter or area of expertise.
Much problem solving involves domain-specific knowledge.Currently we are aiming at building
this software for B.Tech Computer science students .So we have divided the pool of companies
into three categories viz Service based , product based , start-ups. The scores attained by the user
in the three parameters mentioned above will be mapped to weighted scores, the weight of each
parameter will vary based on the category of companies for example weight of data structures will
be 5 for product-based companies and it may be 2 for service-based companies. These weighted
scores will then be used as attribute parameters for machine learning algorithm which will predict
user's chances of grabbing a job in all three categories of companies. As an add-on we will provide
performance report of the user on all parameters since last six assessments.
